# SafeBot

SafeBot is a chatbot for Facebook Messenger that integrates the [SafeTrek API](https://developers.safetrek.io/). It is an always-on and friendly interface the end user can connect with *silently* and without raising alarm or adding stress to the situation.

As of now, this project is under construction. Implementation details and instructions will be posted upon addition. For now, refer to the [Design Outline](docs/design-outline.md) document to read about SafeBot's plans.
